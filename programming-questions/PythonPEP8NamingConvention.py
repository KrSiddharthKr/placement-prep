According to PEP 8, Python variable names should be written in snake_case style.
Snake_case Rules:

Use lowercase letters
Separate words with underscores (_)
No spaces or hyphens

Examples:
✅ Correct (snake_case):
pythonuser_name = "Alice"
total_count = 42
is_valid = True
max_retry_attempts = 3
student_grade_average = 85.5
❌ Incorrect:
pythonuserName = "Alice"        # camelCase (used in other languages)
UserName = "Alice"        # PascalCase (used for class names)
user-name = "Alice"       # kebab-case (not valid Python syntax)
user name = "Alice"       # spaces (not valid Python syntax)
USERNAME = "Alice"        # UPPER_CASE (reserved for constants)
PEP 8 Naming Conventions Summary:

Variables & Functions: snake_case
Constants: UPPER_CASE
Classes: PascalCase
Modules: lowercase or snake_case

Why snake_case?

Readability: Easy to read and understand
Consistency: Standard across the Python community
Python philosophy: "There should be one obvious way to do it"

Remember: Following PEP 8 makes your code more readable and maintainable for other Python developers!
